Working as a software engineer, one thing I have noticed that riles up engineers like nothing other is job  titles. No other topic elicits a more passionate response than when an engineer thinks that their ranking in this made up pecking order is threatened by an unworthy usurper in their company. The pattern is the same, whether it be a 1000+ tech drone corporate or small tight knit startup. 

Although initially used to define various steps in the career ladder <sup><a href="https://www.coderhood.com/software-engineering-job-titles/">1</a></sup> which meant more prestige from the colleagues and more importantly, better compensation from the employer - the ranks have warped into a pissing contest between new developers in the industry. The way I like to look at it is that the ranks are purely indicative of the level of impact, and the breadth of responsibility that any engineering individual in the company has. Unlike popular opinion, I don't think it's necessarily tied to experience either - I have seen engineers with < 2 years of experience handling complex architectural problems and conversely seen someone with > 10 years of experience in the industry struggling with basic programming concepts. There's also the matter of company size, a mid level at a large company might be a senior at a small company and vice versa. The career progression paths are different in every company and where you might lie based on that should also be taken into account.

For someone who has been coding since the age of 13 and has had various jobs at different levels in a professional setting for the past five years, I felt like now was the time to put in writing my thoughts on what constitutes developers at various levels. It is worth noting however that whatever you read here isn't definitive, and as always factors outside of technical and soft skills should be taken into account. 


### Junior Software Engineers

This is someone who's just tasted the wonderful life of what it means to make machines do mans bidding. More often than not, people that are put in this category are either fresh out of university with a degree that had some programming background or have just graduated from an academy, or an institute specializing in teaching people how to code.

In my opinion, such candidates are the lifeblood of any organisation, and they should be given space, time and most importantly mentorship, to grow. Usually the expectations for people in this role are:

- **Write code.** As simple as that. As a junior, the expectations are not multi dimensional, and the company would thank you for just writing code and getting s*&$ done! You might be good at leetcode and blazingly fast at writing linkedlist implementations, but if you can't write proper javascript and css as a frontend engineer, you're already on a sinking ship.
  
- **Learn various auxiliary system.** Professional programming isn't simply writing code, it involves using version control systems, dealing with frameworks, reading APIs and reasoning about the system from them, working with databases etc. No one would expect you to be an expert in these systems, but knowing your way around it is almost essential part of the role. Fortunately, any good company will be willing to spend time and mentorship hours to coach you on any of those topics if you'ev never done them before.

- **Fundamentals and algorithms are good, but pick a modern framework.** As the saying goes, frameworks come and go, but the logic never changes (okay yes, I just made that up). It's hardly a secret that there always seems to be a new framework to achieve a result, this is especially true of frontend - but it's worth investing and picking up one of the popular framework to gain deep knowledge in, especially for juniors. I picked up VueJs and Spring boot as my front end and backend frameworks of choice and have never looked back. It was one of the best decisions I made as a junior.

### Mid level Software Engineer

These are the underdogs of any dev shop. Almost always underappreciated but are the ones making sure the product guys are happy with the sprint velocity. Humor aside, mid level engineers ensure the rhythmic hum of new features being churned and priority bugs being squashed withing the organisation. The people that fit in this role usually have following expectations:

- **Working autonomously or with minimal direction.** A solid mid level engineer, after an initial period of acclimatisation is in tune with the product that the company is selling is able to pick up technically challenging or unassigned work without little to no effort. They may still require some guidance here and there, but for the most part the company, and their peers can be confident that they will always deliver on their assigned work.  

- **Mentoring or showing the ropes to juniors**. Often companies will expect mid level engineers to be showing the ropes to interns and junior software engineers - this can mean many things, however, usually involves pairing with them through onboarding and making sure onboarding docs are up to date, guiding them on fixing issues with individual compoenents and generally being a validatory checkpoint for their development queries.

### Senior Software Engineers

People in these positions are usually regarded as the influencers and drivers of technical direction in a given stack/project domain for the company. Routine expectations for people in such roles are:

- **Deep knowledge of their stack and company's product domain.** Senior engineers are usually expected to be the go to authprity on complext technical questions and architectural design decisions. They're expected to know their technical domain very well, including any niches and quirks and are
