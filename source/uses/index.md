## My Development Setup 🖥

Sometimes I get asked for my development setup and the apps I use for my everyday work. This is a living page meant to contain it all. 


### Hardware

- [Macbook Pro 13"](https://www.apple.com/au/macbook-pro-13/): I have used windows, linux and Mac both professionally and as a hobbyist. Although I was on Ubuntu for a couple of years, nothing beats the general ease of use and dev friendliness of a Mac

- [Dell Ultrasharp 32" 4K Monitor](https://www.amazon.com.au/32-Inch-Screen-LED-Lit-Monitor-U3219Q/dp/B07HDBD9CM): I use a 4K monitor at home to do all my dev and creative (photo editing) work

- [Apple Magic Trackpad 2](https://www.apple.com/au/shop/product/MJ2R2ZA/A/magic-trackpad-2-silver) and [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/product/mx-master-3) (I alternate 🤓)

- [Keychron K2 Mechanical Keyboard with Brown Switches](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-mechanical-keyboard?variant=31063869653081)

## Software

### Development Tools

- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com): I use this as my main terminal with zsh and oh my zsh installed.
- [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/): My IDE of choice. I do all my backend heavy and enterprise work in this. I use this ultimate version as the framework support alone (excluding all the other ultimate perks) makes it more than worth the money
