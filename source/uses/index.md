## My Development Setup 🖥

Sometimes I get asked for my development setup and the apps I use for my everyday work. This is a living page meant to contain it all. 

### Languages ✍️

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) with SpringBoot for quick backend projects 🚀
- [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) for frontend 🤩
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for quick tools and learning some new techniques 🔨
- [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) for building iOS Apps 📱

### Hardware ‍👨‍💻

- [Macbook Pro 13"](https://www.apple.com/au/macbook-pro-13/): I have used windows, linux and Mac both professionally and as a hobbyist. Although I was on Ubuntu for a couple of years, nothing beats the general ease of use and dev friendliness of a Mac

- [Dell Ultrasharp 32" 4K Monitor](https://www.amazon.com.au/32-Inch-Screen-LED-Lit-Monitor-U3219Q/dp/B07HDBD9CM): I use a 4K monitor at home to do all my dev and creative (photo editing) work

- [Apple Magic Trackpad 2](https://www.apple.com/au/shop/product/MJ2R2ZA/A/magic-trackpad-2-silver) and [Logitech MX Master 3](https://www.logitech.com/en-au/product/mx-master-3) (I alternate 🤓)
