Hi! My name is Shiveen 👋🏽 🤓

I like building software and products for companies that are making a difference. I have previously worked in finance @ [JPMorgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/) and lead the platform team for a large scale orders and payments system @ [Ordermentum](https://www.ordermentum.com/). Currently, working on making the retirement lives of average australian better by making [superannuation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superannuation_in_Australia) efficient @ [Grow Super](https://www.growsuper.com/).

Growing up, I've always been fascinated with how the world works, and the ability to write software as living allows me to explore all the creative possibilities I can think of to make someone's life better.

My current software development interest lies in Kotlin as a general purpose programming language to build scalable systrems along with providing performance glue using Rust and building responsive front end systems using VueJs and Node.

In my spare time I love catching up on all things' astronomy 🌌 🚀, history and investment podcasts, and am an avid reader with my favourite genres being hard science fiction, psychology and autobiographical novels. More on my reading [here](/reading).

Outside of my programming pursuits, I am also passionate about camping 🏕, hiking 🥾, landscape photography ⛰ 📷  — and boxing 🥊.
